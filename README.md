## Inspiration
Waste can be harmful to the environment and all of us living in it, especially if not disposed of correctly. We found that knowing how to dispose of different types of waste and correctly identifying waste is not common knowledge. According to the New York Post, “a new survey of 2,000 Americans revealed that 62 percent worry that a lack of knowledge is causing them to recycle incorrectly. Over half of respondents (53 percent) erroneously believe greasy pizza boxes can be recycled, while 68 percent incorrectly think the same for used plastic utensils.”

Many people struggle with identifying the correct method of disposing of waste. It would be helpful if there was a way for people to quickly and easily get the answers they need and learn the proper way of recycling and throwing away waste. Let’s do better for ourselves and the planet we live on!
 
 
## What it does
WasteLess was created to solve the problem of incorrectly identifying and disposing of waste. This app was created to be an easy and quick way to find out how to dispose of the waste around you. It’s easy to just throw everything away in the same trash can especially when you don’t know otherwise or have the time to look into it. 

Instead of guessing if you are disposing of items correctly, you can open WasteLess and find out in seconds. Once you open the app a camera will open up and allow object detection to begin. It will label the items and when you click on it, the information will popup regarding the correct action you need to take. 

WasteLess also includes a recent search/history feature where you can look at previous items you detected. Users can also search for other items by typing in the product’s name. This can be convenient for users who do not want to use their camera or do not have the product close to them.

In order to make this app successful, we needed to research different categories of waste that are commonly encountered. Our categories include biodegradable, compostable, recyclable, hazardous, electronic, biomedical, and household waste. We have included information on each of these in the prototype with the information overview feature, a navigation bar feature on the main menu screen.


## What's next for WasteLess?
Moving forward we are hoping to fully implement WasteLess. We also want to improve our object detection model on the WasteLess mobile app. Currently, most of the objects detected have received an accuracy score within 50-60%. Our goal is to reach an 80-90% accuracy score. 

We also want to localize content and provide information regarding each state. After researching we noticed that some states have different procedures to dispose of waste and it would be helpful if you received the information corresponding to where you live.

One feature we also started adding but want to elaborate on is our fun fact/tip popup. We currently have a place for tips on our learn more page. However, we want to add a place for fun facts that circulate on our start-up page while the app is loading.
